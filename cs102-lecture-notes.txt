Visual studio code is a web editor useful for developing web pages and performing version control using languages like markdown, html etc. Moreover, it supports extensions that are useful in visualizing our code side by side. A webpage can be written using markdown language as is done in the course webpage cs102. Markdown is a lightweight markup languange which can be used to easily to write a formatted text using a plain text editor. Markdown can be used to make the webpage interactive since we can hover to various lists, distinguish within the titles, subtitles and the contents of the webpage. This is done using markdown and visualized in the web interface. The code for the webpage written in markdown is automatically converted into html using markdown previewer. This is done by github which converts the code into markdown to envoke it on the web page.A markdown text is created with an extension as .md. A title for a web page can be created starting with a # then space followed by the name of the title. The subtitle starts with two hashes and three hashes for subsubsections. This is how a web page can be divided into various components and visualized in a structured form.
